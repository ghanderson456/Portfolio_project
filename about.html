            <h2 class="mb-4">I'm Gillian from Mesa, Arizona.</h2>
            <p>I am someone that has a drive to create innovative designs.</p>
            <p>
              After getting my Bachelors in Fine Arts from Arizona State
              University in 2013 I went to work for a financial company. While
              working there I became a specialist at researching a customer’s
              problem until solved but I always felt like something was missing.
              That creative itch of mine needed to be scratched.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the years I have developed a curiosity of how people interact
              with the digital experience. While researching potential new
              careers I found UX/UI design. The idea of combining my love of
              creativity and my previous work experience of research and
              customer satisfaction in UX/UI design is a dream come true. After
              expanding my education with a certificate from DesignLab’s UX
              Academy in 2020-2021 I have taken off running gaining experience
              through freelance work supporting my community’s local small
              businesses.
            </p>
            <p>
              I look forward to adding a fresh perspective to a team working to
              better the user experience.
